*Localizing Tunnelblick VPN Configurations*

Configuration names (and the names of the folders that contain them) can be localized (as of build 4039).

A configurations can include localization information for itself, or, in a Deployed version of Tunnelblick,  localization information may be contained in the Deploy folder and used for all configurations.

For a configuration to include localization information, the configuration must include an [cPkgs#Info.plist Info.plist] file and one or more "lproj" folders.

If localization is done via the Deploy folder, the Deploy folder must contain an OS X bundle (a folder with a special structure) named "Localization.bundle". That bundle must include a Contents folder, which must contain an Info.plist file and a "Resources" folder, which must contain one or more "lproj" folders.

<hr>

The Info.plist file may contain any of the entries normally allowed in a [cPkgs#Info.plist .tblk Info.plist], but for localization the file must include the following entries (each value is a string):
 * CFBundleDevelopmentRegion, "English"
 * CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion, "6.0"
 * CFBundleIdentifier, a reverse-domain, for example, "com.example.tunnelblick.configuration.001"

<hr>

Each "lproj" folder (except English) has as its name the [http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php ISO-639-1] two-letter abbreviation of the language and an extension of "lproj". For example, "JA.lproj" is the folder with Japanese strings, "ES.lproj" is the folder with Spanish strings, etc. One exception is English, which is named English.lproj. Other exceptions include Chinese and other languages for which there are multiple dilalects. See [http://commons.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Learning_Cocoa_with_Objective-C/Miscellaneous_Topics/Localization#Localizing_Resources Localizing Resources] or examine the "lproj" folders in /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources.

Each "lproj" folder should contain a single file named "Localizable.strings".

Each "Localizable.strings" file should be a UTF-8 encoded text file with lines of the following format:

 "file or folder name"="translated name";

For example, if you have configurations in folders named "fast" and "slow", and each configuration contains a "New York" and "San Juan" folder, you would have a Localizable.strings file in each "lproj" folder. The file for English (in English.lproj) might look like the following:

 "fast"="fast";<br>
 "slow"="slow";<br>
 "New York"="New York";<br>
 "San Juan"="San Juan";<br>

The file for Spanish (in ES.lproj) might look like the following (Spanish speakers, please forgive any language errors!):

 "fast"="r√°pido";<br>
 "slow"="lenta";<br>
 "New York"="Nueva York";<br>
 "San Juan"="San Juan";<br>

You can download a [http://sourceforge.net/projects/tunnelblick/files/All%20files/Misc/LocalizationWithSubfolderExample.tblk.zip/download download sample of a "nested" .tblk] which contains a regular configuration and a configuration in a subfolder. The sample configurations are localized for English, German, and Spanish as described above.
