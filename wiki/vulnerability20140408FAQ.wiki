<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

==What is the vulnerability?==
 Some versions of Tunnelblick include a version of the OpenSSL library that is vulnerable to the "heartbeat attack" (a/k/a "heartbleed"). See [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt OpenSSL Security Advisory 07 Apr 2014].
 
==How can I protect my computer from these vulnerabilities?==
 Update to the latest version of Tunnelblick (either the latest stable version or the latest beta version).
 
==Can Tunnelblick Updates Be Compromised by This Vulnerability?==
 No. This vulnerability may be able to compromise the security of https:, allowing "Man in the middle" attacks. However, there is an additional protection built into the Tunnelblick update process: updates are signed with a digital signature. When you update Tunnelblick, the program checks the digital signature.

==How can I update to the latest version of Tunnelblick?==
 You will need your computer's administrator password to update Tunnelblick.

 * If you have Tunnelblick 3.1 or higher, you can use Tunnelblick's built-in update function.
 * You can install the latest version of Tunnelblick (it will install into /Applications).
 
 Note: Users of a "[cCusDeployed Deployed]" version of Tunnelblick must obtain a new version of Tunnelblick from the person or organization that distributed their "[cCusDeployed Deployed]" version. See [#How_can_I_know_if_I_am_using_a_Deployed_version How can I know if I am using a Deployed version].

==How can I know if I am using a Deployed version?==

 Note: If you try to install Tunnelblick 3.2beta22 or higher on a computer that has a "[cCusDeployed Deployed]" version of Tunnelblick, an error message will be displayed and the installation will not be performed.
