==Updatable Configurations==
A Tunnelblick VPN Configuration ("Configuration") can be updated the same way that the Tunnelblick application itself is updated. Because a Configuration can contain any number of Configurations within it, you can have a single Configuration that updates all of your VPN configurations at once.

By adding a few entries to a a Configuration's Info.plist file, a Configuration will become "updatable". When launched, and periodically afterward, Tunnelblick will check a webpage for information about updates to the configuration. If a new version of the Configuration is available, the user will be asked for permission to update it. If granted, the new configuration will be installed and available for use immediately, without relaunching Tunnelblick.

Configuration updates are handled by [http://sparkle-project.org Sparkle Updater], just like Tunnelblick updates. (Sparkle is built into Tunnelblick.)

In addition to the Configuration itself, you must provide an update server -- a web server with the update information.

==What Makes a Configuration Updatable==
To be updatable, a Configuration must contain an [cPkgs#Info.plist Info.plist], and the Info.plist must include the following entries:
 * *CFBundleIdentifier*, a string containng a reverse-domain uniquely identifying the Configuration. For example, "com.example.tunnelblick.updatable-configurations.001".
 * *CFBundleVersion*, a string containing a version number consisting only of the digits 0-9 and periods. For example, "1.0", "1.3.1", etc.
 * *TBBundleVersion*, a string "1". (This is required in any Configuration Info.plist, whether or not it is updatable.)
 * *SUFeedURL*, a string with the URL for the "appcast" that gives information about updates to the Configuration. For example, "https`:``/``/`example.com`/`tunnelblick`/`configs`/`001`/`appcast`.`rss". If this is not an "https:" URL, the SUPublicDSAKeyFile entry and associated file are required. _*This is the entry which makes a Configuration updatable.*_

Optional Info.plist entries include those normally allowed in the Info.plist of a Configuration -- *TBReplaceIdentical*, *TBSharePackage*, etc.

Additional optional Info.plist entries for an updatable Configuration are all [http://sparkle-project.org Sparkle Updater] entries. (Please note that Tunnelblick uses a customized version of Sparkle 1.5b6 so some features in newer versions of Sparkle may not be available.) Here are comments on some entries:
 * *SUScheduledCheckInterval*: The time, in seconds, between checks. Minimum of 60; default is 3600 (one hour).
 * *SUPublicDSAKeyFile*: The filename and extension of a file containing the public DSA key. This key and file are required if https: is not used in the SUFeedURL entry. The file must be contained in the Configuration, either directly in the .tblk, or in the .tblk/Contents/Resources folder.
 * *SUAllowsAutomaticUpdates*: If present, must be a binary "NO".
 * *SUEnableAutomaticChecks*: If present, must be a binary "NO".
 * *SUEnableSystemProfiling*: If present, must be a binary "NO".
 * *SUShowReleaseNotes*: If present, must be a binary "YES".
(Some of these "must be" restrictions may be relaxed in a later version of Tunnelblick.)

==The Update Server==
The update mechanism uses a web server to provide update information. Minimally, that web server serves the following files:
 * The appcast: An XML file which contains information about available updates.
 * For each available update:
  * The release notes: An html page which is displayed to the user when the update is available.
  * The updated configuration: A .zip or .dmg file of the updated Configuration, suitable for downloading.

==The Appcast==
The appcast is an XML file that contains information about each available update, including:
 * The conditions under which the update is considered appropriate.
 * The URL for the "release notes" page.
 * The URL for the updated configuration.

Here is a sample appcast.rss:

Notes on the appcast entries:

*_`<`title`>`_* and *_`<`description`>`_*

 The title and description entries are not shown to the user during the update process; they appear if you go to the page in a browser.

*_`<`link`>`https`:``/``/`www.example.com`/`tunnelblick`/`configurations`/`001`/`appcast`.`rss`<`/link`>`_*

 The URL of the appcast.rss itself.

*_https`:``/``/`www.example.com`/`tunnelblick`/`configurations`/`001`/`UpdateNotes`.`html_*

 The URL of the page that is presented to the user to explain the update.

*_`<`pubDate`>`Mon,  14 Jul 2014 14:55:20 -0400`<``/`pubDate`>`_*

 The date that the update was published.

*_url="https`:``/``/`www.example.com`/`tunnelblick`/`configurations`/`001`/`configurations`.`zip"_*

 The URL of the update itself -- a .zip or .dmg file that contains the updated .tblk.

*_sparkle:version="1.2.3"_*

 The machine-readable version number of the update. Consists of one, two, or three numbers separated by periods. This is compared to the CFBundleIdentifier in the user's configuration to determine if the update is newer or not. _This should be the same as the CFBundleVersion in the Info.plist in the updated Configuration._

*_sparkle:shortVersionString="VPN Configurations 1.2.3"_*

 The human-readable version number. This is what is presented to the user.

*_sparkle:dsaSignature="MCwCFE6twQrvEOeFyXLMCJsClV2tM7RGAhQ53VjexE4Gf0SSswNUSMkg3UeXZg=="_*

 The DSA signature of the update file. (The signature of the .zip or .dmg file.)

*_length="1234"_*

 The length in bytes of the .tblk. (Determined by Finder's Get Info command or by "stat -f %z configurations.tblk".

(Note that the DSA signature is computed on the .zip or .dmg, but the length is the length of the .tblk.)

==Update Notes==
The update notes are just an HTML file that is presented to the user when an update is available.

Here is the sample update notes file for Tunnelblick release 3.4beta30:

==https: and Digital Signatures==
It is advisable to use https: for all update transactions. 

If the updates are not done using https:, you must digitally sign the update.

Although using https: makes it unnecessary to digitally sign the update, signing is also recommended.

For more information on digitally signing the update, see the [http://sparkle-project.org Sparkle Updater] documentation. (Note that (A) the digital signature is computed from the .zip or .dmg file, not the .tblk., and (B) the digital signature has nothing to do with the digital signature that applications on OS X use.)

==More Information==
For more information about the update process or these files, see the [http://sparkle-project.org Sparkle Updater website]. (Please note that Tunnelblick uses a customized version of Sparkle 1.5b6 so some features in newer versions of Sparkle may not be available.)
