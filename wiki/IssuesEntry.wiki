Before *posting a new* Issue, please

  * Take a look at [KnownIssues Known Issues] for the stable release or [wKnown Known Issues] and [wCommonProblems Common Problems] for a Beta release.

  * Discuss the problem, suggestion, feature request, etc. in the [http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss Tunnelblick Discussion Group]. More people monitor the discussion group and you will probably receive help more quickly there than if you post an Issue.

No, I really want to go to [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/issues/list Tunnelblick Issues].
