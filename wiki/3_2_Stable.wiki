#summary Stable Releases
#sidebar 3_2_Sb

A stable release is a version that has been tested as thoroughly as possible and is as reliable as we can make it. It usually does not have all the new features of a [3_2_Beta beta release], but may be more reliable.

All available releases may be found on the [DownloadsEntry Downloads page].

Cumulative [3_2_RlsNotes Release Notes] describe changes for all versions.
