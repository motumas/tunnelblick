#summary Distributing Tunnelblick

Tunnelblick is made available under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html GNU General Public License, version 2]  ("GPL"). It can be freely distributed within the restrictions of that license.
<hr>
*An easy way to distribute Tunnelblick to multiple clients or servers is to distribute your configurations bundled together with Tunnelblick*. Your configurations will be installed automatically when the user installs the Tunnelblick application and can be automatically updated from your webserver (see [cUpdatableConfigurations Updatable Configurations]).

A simple way to do that is to:
 * Create an empty folder.
 * Copy Tunnelblick.app into the folder.
 * Create a subfolder named ".auto-install" or "auto-install".
 * Copy your [cPkgs ".tblk" configuration files] into the subfolder.
 * Control-click the outer folder and select "Compress..." (or compress the folder with any compression utility).
The resulting .zip file may be distributed to users. When the user double-clicks on the Tunnelblick icon in the expanded folder, the user will be asked for a computer administrator's username and password to install both the program and the configurations.

For more details, see [cPkgs Tunnelblick VPN Configurations], especially the [cPkgs#Automatic_Installation Automatic Installation] and [cPkgs#Info.plist Info.plist] sections. See [cUpdatableConfigurations Updatable Configurations] for information on creating and using configurations that can be automatically updated from your website.

<hr>

*You can also distribute configurations without Tunnelblick and have them installed by a simple double-click.*

To do this, your users must first download and install Tunnelblick. Then they can double-click one or more [cPkgs ".tblk" configuration files] to install them. You can [cPkgs#Nested_Configurations "nest"] configurations inside an outer configuration so that the user only needs to double-click once to install all of the configurations.

<hr>

*A more complex way of distributing configurations along with Tunnelblick is to create a [cCusDeployed "Deployed" version] of Tunnelblick:*
 * Deployed versions of Tunnelblick *must be [cBuild built] from [cRebranding rebranded] source code* and the rebranded source code must be made available to anyone to whom a binary is "distributed" as defined by the GPL.
 * A "Deployed" version contains, within the Tunnelblick application itself, all of the configurations, certificates, keys, and scripts needed for the connection(s) that you wish to make available.
 * A "Deployed" version can also contain "forced" preferences, which the user is not allowed to override, which can avoid problems caused by users inadvertently changing critical configuration parameters.
 * Because a "Deployed" version contains the configurations within the program,  when the program is updated, the configurations are updated.
 * Any user of the computer can connect using the configuration(s).
