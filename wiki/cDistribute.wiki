#summary Distributing Tunnelblick

Tunnelblick is made available under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html GNU General Public License, version 2]  ("GPL"). It can be freely distributed within the restrictions of that license.

If you are distributing Tunnelblick to multiple clients or servers, you might want to consider using a [cCusDeployed "Deployed" version] of Tunnelblick:
 * Deployed versions of Tunnelblick *must be [cBuild built] from [cRebranding rebranded] source code* and the rebranded source code must be made available to anyone to whom a binary is "distributed" as defined by the GPL.
 * A "Deployed" version contains, within the Tunnelblick application itself, all of the configurations, certificates, keys, and scripts needed for the connection(s) that you wish to make available.
 * A "Deployed" version can also contain "forced" preferences, which the user is not allowed to override, which can avoid problems caused by users inadvertently changing critical configuration parameters.
 * Any user of the computer can connect using the configuration(s).

*If you would prefer not to build your own version of Tunnelblick*, you should consider using "standard" Tunnelblick bundled together with your [cConfigT#Creating_and_Installing_a_Tunnelblick_VPN_Configuration Tunnelblick VPN Configurations]. This avoids the need to build a rebranded version of Tunnelblick. Tunnelblick VPN Configurations which are contained on a disk image or .zip file used to distribute the application may be automatically installed when the application itself is installed. See [cPkgs Tunnelblick VPN Configurations] for detailed information.
