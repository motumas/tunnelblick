#summary Distributing Tunnelblick
#sidebar cSb

Tunnelblick is made available under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html GNU General Public License, version 2]. It can be freely distributed within the restrictions of that license.

If you are distributing Tunnelblick to multiple clients or servers, you might want to consider using a [cCusDeployed "Deployed" version] of Tunnelblick:
 * A "Deployed" version contains, within the Tunnelblick application itself, all of the configurations, certificates, keys, and scripts needed for the connection(s) that you wish to make available.
 * A "Deployed" version can also contain "forced" preferences, which the user is not allowed to override, which can avoid problems caused by users inadvertently changing critical configuration parameters.
 * Any user of the computer who can access a "Deployed" version of Tunnelblick can connect using the configuration(s). For example, if Tunnelblick.app is stored in /Applications, everyone who uses the computer will be able to connect.
 * A minimal "Deployed" version can be created very easily on any platform. See [wMinimalDeployed How To Make a "Deployed" Version of Tunnelblick].

If you would prefer to distribute configurations separately from the Tunnelblick application, you should consider using [cConfigT Tunnelblick VPN Configurations]:
 * A Tunnelblick VPN Configuration is an easily constructed Mac OS X package which contains a configuration file and certificates, keys, and scripts to support the configuration.
 * A Tunnelblick VPN Configuration may be private to each individual user (and need to be installed separately for each user), or it may be shared by all users of the computer.
 * A Tunnelblick VPN Configuration can optionally contain identification and version information which Tunnelblick will use when a user installs or reinstalls a configuration.
 * A Tunnelblick VPN Configuration can also contain default preferences which are installed when the configuration is first used, but which the user can subsequently override.
 * Tunnelblick VPN Configurations which are contained on the disk image used to distribute the application may be automatically installed when the application itself is installed.
