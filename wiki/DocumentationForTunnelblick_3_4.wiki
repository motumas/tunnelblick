==Summary of Changes from Version 3.3 to Version 3.4==

 For details of the changes from Tunnelblick version 3.3 to version 3.4, see the [RlsNotes Release Notes].

==Better Security==
 * Fixes several security-related bugs.
 * Includes the latest stable versions of OpenVPN, LZO, the OpenSSL library, and Tuntap.
 * Uses https: for updates and IP address checks (still uses digital signatures for additional security).
 * Does additional checks to ensure the program's integrity.

==Better Usability==
 * Enhances installation of configurations with improved error detection and correction and automatic conversion of OpenVPN configurations.
 * On OS X 10.6 ('Snow Leopard') and higher, allows the user to select multiple configurations in the VPN Detailsâ€¦ window and then change settings for all of the selected configurations.
 * Includes a new status icon (the icon in the menu bar) more in keeping with recent OS X aesthetics.
 * Changes many warning dialogs so they do not block other Tunnelblick operations.
 
==More Capabilities==
 * On OS X 10.6.8 and higher when using OpenVPN 2.3.3 and higher in a TUN configuration, Tunnelblick no longer automatically loads the tunnelblick tun kernel extension (kext). In this situation, OpenVPN will use the UTUN device driver built into OS X.
 * Runs on OS X 10.4 through 10.10 ("Tiger", "Leopard", "Snow Leopard", "Lion", "Mountain Lion", "Mavericks", and "Yosemite").

==Better Reliability==
   * Fixes many (most? all?) problems. Please report problems to the [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tunnelblick-discuss Tunnelblick Discussion Group].
      
==Worse Localization==
   * Sorry, but 3.3.0 does not have complete localization.
   * To help with localization, please email jkbullard at gmail for instructions.
