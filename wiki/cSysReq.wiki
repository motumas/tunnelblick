Note: To use Tunnelblick you need access to a VPN server -- your computer is one end of the tunnel and the VPN server is the other end. See [cGettingVPNService Getting VPN Service] for details.

Tunnelblick comes as a ready-to-use Universal application with all necessary binaries and drivers (including OpenVPN and tun/tap). No additional installation is necessary -- just add your configuration and encryption information.

Tunnelblick 3.1 runs on OS X 10.4 through 10.6 ("Tiger", "Leopard", and "Snow Leopard").

Tunnelblick 3.2beta22 and higher run on OS X 10.7 ("Lion").

Tunnelblick 3.3beta02 and higher run on OS X 10.8 ("Mountain Lion").

Tunnelblick 2.0.1 is an old version that works on OS X 10.3 ("Panther").

*About 64-bit and PPC compatibility*: Tunnelblick is a Universal 32-bit application, so it runs as an application in 32-bit mode on both Intel and PowerPC Macs under Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard, and Lion. 

Tunnelblick includes Intel and PowerPC 32/64-bit versions of tun.kext and tap.kext. 32-bit kernels use the 32-bit tun/tap, and 64-bit kernels use the 64-bit tun/tap.
