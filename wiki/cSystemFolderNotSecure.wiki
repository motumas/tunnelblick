===System Folder Security===
One aspect of computer security is the security of system files and folders -- files and folders created by OS X to run your computer. The security is primarily controlled by the ownership and permissions of the files and folders that make up OS X and the applications and data on your computer.

Tunnelblick checks the security of itself and of the parts of OS X that it uses. That sometimes results in Tunnelblick complaining that a system folder is not secure, and refusing to connect a VPN. For example, you might see the following message after launching Tunnelblick:

Other problems with system folder security may only appear when you try to connect to a VPN.

Tunnelblick repairs the security of all of its own files and folders, but does not repair files and folders that it does not create, such as system folders.

===How System Folders Become Insecure===
System folders are secure when OS X is installed, and usually only become insecure as the result of a program installer behaving improperly. System folders could become insecure because of malware, but that is rare:
 * In May 2014, Apple's iTunes 11.2 update caused each system boot to set insecure permissions on /Users and /Users/Shared. This was corrected in iTunes 11.2.1.
 * There are reports that some MacPorts installers makes /usr insecure, and that some SPSS and xQuartz installers and some player application installers for Vulkano streaming video make /Applications insecure.

===Repairing System Folder Security===
On OS X 10.6 and higher, the ownership and permissions of system folders can be repaired by using the "Disk Utility" application (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility). Select the boot volume in the list on the left, and do a "Repair Disk Permissions".

Disk Utility in OS X 10.5 and lower does not fix the ownership and permissions of system folders; they must be repaired manually in the Terminal application (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal).

===Correct System Folder Ownership and Permissions===
System folder ownership and permissions vary from folder to folder and from one version of OS X to another. The following table lists the standard (secure) ownership and permissions for selected system folders under various versions of OS X.

*For OS X 10.7 - 10.9:*
|| Folder                                   || Owner  || Group || Permissions || Octal || <font color="red">Use "Repair Disk Permissions" in Disk Utility</font>  ||
|| /Applications                        || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-x   || 0775 ||
|| /Library                                 || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-t    ||1775 ||
|| /Library/Application Support || root     || wheel || rwxrwxr-t    || 1775 ||
|| /Users                                   || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-x   || 0775 ||
|| /usr                                      || root     ||  wheel || rwxr-xr-x    || 0755 ||

*For OS X 10.6:*
|| Folder                                   || Owner  || Group || Permissions || Octal || <font color="red">Use "Repair Disk Permissions" in Disk Utility</font>  ||
|| /Applications                        || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-x   || 0775 ||
|| /Library                                 || root     || wheel || rwxr-xr-x    || 0755 ||
|| /Library/Application Support || root     || admin || rwxr-xr-x    ||0755 ||
|| /Users                                   || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-x   || 0775 ||
|| /usr                                      || root     ||  wheel || rwxr-xr-x    || 0755 ||

*For OS X 10.5: *
|| Folder                                   || Owner  || Group || Permissions || Octal || Terminal command to repair||
|| /Applications                        || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-x   || 0775 || sudo chown root:admin /Applications; sudo chmod 0775 /Applications ||
|| /Library                                 || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-t    ||1775 || sudo chown root:admin /Library; sudo chmod 1775 /Library ||
|| /Library/Application Support || root     || wheel  || rwxr-xr-x    ||0755 || sudo chown root:wheel /Library/Application Support; sudo chmod 0755 /Library/Application Support ||
|| /Users                                   || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-x   || 0775 || sudo chown root:admin /Users; sudo chmod 0775 /Users ||
|| /usr                                      || root     ||  wheel || rwxr-xr-x    || 0755 || sudo chown root:wheel /usr; sudo chmod 0755 /usr ||

*For OS X 10.4:*

|| Folder                                   || Owner  || Group || Permissions || Octal || Terminal command to repair ||
|| /Applications                        || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-x   || 0775 || sudo chown root:admin /Applications; sudo chmod 0775 /Applications ||
|| /Library                                 || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-t    ||1775  || sudo chown root:admin /Library; sudo chmod 1775 /Library ||
|| /Library/Application Support || root     || admin  || rwxrwxr-x   ||0775 || sudo chown root:admin /Library/Application Support; sudo chmod 0775 /Library/Application Support ||
|| /Users                                   || root     || admin || rwxrwxr-t    ||1775  || sudo chown root:admin /Users; sudo chmod 1775 /Users ||
