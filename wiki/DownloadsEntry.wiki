 ==User-Contributed Scripts==
 These downloads have been contributed by users and usually help deal with special circumstances. They are not endorsed or checked by the Tunnelblick project or Google, and you use them at your own risk. To contribute a download, please email project owner [http://code.google.com/u/jkbullard/ Jon].

   * *!AppleScript to Connect/Disconnect to an Ordered List of VPNs*:  See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tunnelblick-discuss/h4TpuMZ1uPY/7wwmF2LQhOYJ this discussion].

 <font color="red">Note: the following scripts are executed as root.</font> [cUsingScripts Instructions for using scripts].

    * *Scripts to Unload Cisco Tun Kext*:  _*[http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/downloads/detail?name=user-contributed-001-pre-post.zip user-contributed-001-pre-post.zip]*_ Contributed by petiepooo. These scripts unload the Cisco !AnyConnect tun kext before a Tunnelblick connection is started, and reload the Cisco tun kext after a Tunnelblick connection is stopped. (The Cisco kext interferes with Tunnelblick's operation of tun connections.) Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher.

    * *Scripts to Mount/Unmount a Volume*:  _*[http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/downloads/detail?name=user-contributed-002-mount-unmount-volume.zip user-contributed-002-mount-unmount-volume.zip]*_ Contributed by John Griffis. These scripts mount a volume after a configuration is connected and unmount it when the configuration is disconnected. Scripts must be edited before use (in any plain-text editor) to specify details of the volume to be connected. Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher. For a note about connecting to a CIFS account, see <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/b2jboQHeqAs/discussion">https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tunnelblick-discuss/b2jboQHeqAs/discussion</a>.

These scripts  provide a mechanism for the user to be alerted when the VPN has been up for more than 20 minutes or when bandwidth has exceeded 100MB. See [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tunnelblick-discuss/7lGWKR1-rC4/OGHhCfmrXfgJ this post] on the Tunnelblick Discussion Group for details. Requires Growl. Must be used in a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration (.tblk package) with Tunnelblick 3.1beta06 or higher. <strong><font color="red">Includes compiled binaries; use at your own risk.</font></strong>
