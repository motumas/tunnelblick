==Starting a Translation==
Please contact project owner Jon via email at jkbullard at gmail dot com before starting a translation -- he will tell you about other translators for your language that you should coordinate with, and supply you with the appropriate versions of files that need translating.

==".strings" Files and .rtf Files==
Tunnelblick has two types of files for each language:
 * *.strings files* contain strings -- words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs -- that are to be translated from English to the target language.
 * *.rtf files* each contain an entire document that is to be translated to the target language.

Most of the translation work is done with .strings files, so usually they are translated first.

==You Need Not Translate Everything==
If you can translate everything, that's great. But there are a lot of strings. They are placed in the .strings files in approximate order of importance, so start at the top and work your way down.

==Integrating the ".strings" Files into Tunnelblick==
To integrate your translation into Tunnelblick, return your translated or partially translated file(s) to project owner Jon via email at jkbullard at gmail dot com. He will reply with a link to a version of Tunnelblick that incorporates your translations (and perhaps others' translations, too).

A program is used to integrate the .strings files into Tunnelblick. The program:
 * Accepts Localizable.strings or NeedsTranslation.strings files.
 * Accepts files with translated and untranslated strings, i.e. partially translated files.
 * Accepts strings in any order.
 * Marks strings as needing translation or removes that marking.
 * Updates the Localizable.strings !NeedsTranslations.strings, and Removed.strings files.
