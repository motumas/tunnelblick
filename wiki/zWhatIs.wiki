#summary What is Tunnelblick?
#sidebar zSb

  * *Explanation 1*: Tunnelblick is a program that can be used to securely connect a Mac running OS X to an OpenVPN server. The server then connects the Mac to a remote network or to the Internet, bypassing untrusted networks, censorship, and eavesdropping. 

 It does this by creating a "Virtual Private Network", or "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Virtual_Private_Network VPN] `[`wiktionary.org`]`", to the OpenVPN server using a program named "OpenVPN", which is included within the Tunnelblick application. When you connect through a VPN, your computer sends all network traffic through a "tunnel" to the VPN server, which then passes on your network traffic to a local network or the Internet. It is as if you were connecting to the network or Internet through the VPN server instead of your computer. Usually, all traffic between your computer and the VPN server is encrypted.

  VPNs are primarily used two ways, or sometimes both ways simultaneously:
    * To securely connect a computer to the Internet, even though it may be connecting through an untrusted network (a wireless network at a hotel or airport, for example); and
    * To securely connect a computer to a company's internal network or some part of it (a branch office, for example).

  In addition to Tunnelblick, you need access to a VPN server. Your company may provide one, or you can obtain VPN service from any of several VPN service providers, or you can use another one of your computers or a router to act as a VPN server. See [zGettingVPNService Getting VPN Service] for details.

  * *Explanation 2*: Tunnelblick is a ready-to-use Graphic User Interface (GUI) for OpenVPN on Mac OS X. It provides easy-to-use control of OpenVPN server and/or client connections.

  It runs on OS X Tiger (10.4), Leopard (10.5), and Snow Leopard (10.6). It comes as a ready-to-use Universal application with all necessary binaries and drivers (including OpenVPN and tun/tap) included. No additional installation is necessary -- just add your configuration and encryption information.
