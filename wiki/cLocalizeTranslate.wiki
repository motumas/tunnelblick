 <font color="red">*Translators are needed for Arabic, Chinese (traditional), Japanese, and Korean.* [cLocalizeTranslate Details]</font>

 * The _new_ way of localizing the Tunnelblick application is described on this page.

 * Localizing the names of configurations and other content that can be added to Tunnelblick is described in [cLocalizeConfigurations Other Localization].

 * Comments about specific strings used in Tunnelblick are on the [cTranslationNotes Translation Notes] page.

 * The _old_ way of localizing is described in [cLocalize Localizing Tunnelblick] and [cTranslateStrings Translating .strings Files].

<hr>
*The _new_ Way*
 * Tunnelblick is localized on [https://crowdin.com/project/tunnelblick crowdin.com], a translation management site that provides free service for open source projects such as Tunnelblick. Crowdin does not do the actual translations; it only provides the infrastructure in which translators can work and a way of managing those translators.

 * For Tunnelblick, localization consists solely of translating strings. No graphic manipulation or spacing or moving of text is required.

 * All translation work is done in a specialized translation editor in your browser.

 * *<font color="red">To join the localization team, please email project owner jkbullard at gmail.</font>*
  * You can help a little or a lot, all help is welcome!
  * Everyone who makes a meaningful contribution will be credited on Tunnelblick's [cThanks Thanks page] and on the "Info" panel of the application itself.

  * See [cUsingCrowdin Using Crowdin] for specific procedures that the Tunnelblick Crowdin project uses to sign up for and use Crowdin.
