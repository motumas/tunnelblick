==How and What to Post==

*If you are having a problem with Tunnelblick, please:*

 If possible, use the latest "beta" version of Tunnelblick, which has additional logging that can help show the cause of problems.

 # Make sure you do not have manually set DNS server addresses in OS X System Preferences : Network (select the primary interface, click the "Advanced..." button, then the DNS tab; there should be no addresses on the left that are not dimmed).
 # Open the "VPN Detailsâ€¦" window.
 # Select the configuration you want to connect in the list on the left.
 # Make sure that "Set DNS/WINS" is set to "Set nameserver". (This is the default setting and will enable extra debugging and logging.)
 # Click the "Advanced" button on the right; a new window will appear.
 # Make sure that "Check if the apparent public IP address changed after connecting" is checked.
 # Close the "Advanced" window.
 # Click on the "Log" tab.
 # Click on the "Connect" button.
 # Wait until the problem occurs. *If the problem is that no connection is made, wait at least 70 seconds.*
 # If you can, click on the "Disconnect" button and wait until the disconnection is complete. If the disconnection is not complete within 20 seconds, continue anyway.
 # Click on the "Copy Diagnostic Info to the Clipboard" button.
 # Close Tunnelblick.
 # Paste into an email or web form.
 # Remove any sensitive information before sending the email or the form.
