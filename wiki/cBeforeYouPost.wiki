==What to Post==

If you are having a problem with Tunnelblick, it is best to open the "VPN Details…" window and click on the "Log" tab before doing a complete connect/disconnect cycle (if you can) to obtain fresh diagnostic information for your submission.

*If possible, please use the "Copy Diagnostic Info to the Clipboard" button*, then paste into an email or web form and edit out sensitive information. The button is available in Tunnelblick 3.3beta38 and higher, and is located on the "Log" tab of the "Preferences" panel of the "VPN Details…" window.

*Otherwise, please include the following with your question*:
 * the contents of your configuration file;
 * the entire contents of the Tunnelblick log; and
 * the end of the Console log.
 Be sure to edit out any sensitive information such as server IP addresses and private keys.

 To put the contents of your configuration file on the Clipboard so you can paste it into an email, open it in !TextEdit as follows:
 # Click the Tunnelblick icon
 # Click "VPN Details…"
 # Select the "Configurations" panel if it is not already selected
 # Select the configuration whose file you want to look at in the list on the left
 # Click the little "gear" icon at the bottom of the list on the left
 # Select "Edit OpenVPN Configuration File…" (or possibly "Examine OpenVPN Configuration File…").
 # In !TextEdit you can Edit : Select All and then Edit : Copy to get the contents of the configuration file put into the clipboard.

 See the [cOpenVPNLog Tunnelblick Log] and the [cConsoleLog Console Log] for information on the logs.
