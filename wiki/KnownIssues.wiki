*PLEASE* discuss any problems on the [http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss Tunnelblick Discussion List].

The following are known problems or limitations in Tunnelblick version 3.0:

  * A problem has been reported when using Dropbox to sync the user's home folder if Tunnelblick is installed -- see [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/issues/detail?id=182 Tunnelblick Issue 182] for details and a solution.

  * If both ~/Library/openvpn and ~/Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations exist *and are folders*, Tunnelblick will refuse to start, displaying a dialog that "Tunnelblick could not be launched because of a problem with the configuration." The Console log will show an entry that both folders exist and "are folders, so ~/Library/openvpn cannot be moved".

  To work around this, move the contents of  ~/Library/openvpn to the other folder, delete the empty ~/Library/openvpn, and then launch Tunnelblick again. *Note that in some circumstances, ~/Library/openvpn exists and is a link to the other folder; that arrangement will not cause this problem and should not be disturbed.*

  * If "Monitor connection" is checked, Tunnelblick monitors the network interface that connects to the VPN and will restart the connection if changes to DNS or WINS are detected. With some network configurations this causes repeated disconnects/reconnects every few seconds. To avoid this, uncheck "Monitor connection" in the tab for the problematic configuration on the "Details..." window or use the "`*`-leasewatchOptions" [wPrefs preference].

  * The standard scripts that "Set nameserver" uses handle DNS for most common setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else. See [UsingTunnelblick the Using Tunnelblick] for details.

  * Tunnelblick does not implement pushing domain information from the server (only DNS and WINS information) except with "Set nameserver (alternative 1)".

  * When attempting to connect to a VPN, Tunnelblick may fail to load tun.kext and tap.kext. This can happen when another program, or another version of Tunnelblick, has loaded different versions of tun.kext and tap.kext. For example, the Cisco VPN client loads tun.kext and tap.kext at system startup, and they must be unloaded for Tunnelblick to work. Viscosity loads tun.kext and tap.kext when it is running. This problem may be avoided (for Viscosity) by quitting Viscosity, or (for Cisco) by using the automatic script written for this purpose (available on the [https://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/DownloadsEntry?tm=2#User-Contributed Downloads] page), or entering the following command:
{{{
  sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoTUN stop 
}}}

  * If "Set nameserver" is checked, all "up" and "down" options in the OpenVPN configuration file will be ignored. To work around this, include appropriate parts of the standard up/down scripts in your own scripts and do not check "Set nameserver". (The reason for this is that OpenVPN's "down-pre" option cannot be used with the standard "Set nameserver" down script, but may be used by custom scripts, so the two scripts cannot be used together.)

  * If a custom up or down script contains Windows line breaks (CR-LF), it cannot be executed on OS X. The OpenVPN log displayed in the "Details…" window will show an error message of "script failed: could not execute external program". You must remove the CR characters so the file has standard Unix line breaks (LF). This is an OS X limitation.

  * Updates will fail if the name of Tunnelblick is not "Tunnelblick" or "Tunnelblick.app". To avoid this, rename the application temporarily, perform the update, then restore the original name. (You must change the name of the application itself, not the name of an alias or shortcut to the application.)

  * Localization is not complete. We need additional translations to Catalan, Chinese (both simplified and traditional), Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, and Norwegian (Norsk Bokmål). If you can help with these or any other languages, please contact [http://code.google.com/u/jkbullard/ Jon].
