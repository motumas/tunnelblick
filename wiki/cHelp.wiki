===Getting Help===
*There are three primary resources for help with Tunnelblick:*<br />

 * *Your VPN service provider is the best place to go if your VPN was set up by someone else*.
  * Your VPN service provider is the organization which gave you your configuration files, and perhaps a username and password, and to which you are probably paying a fee for VPN service.
  * Tunnelblick is just the free software that many VPN service providers recommend or supply to their customers. We do not provide VPN service, just software.
  * For a list of Mac-friendly VPN service providers, see [cGettingVPNService Getting VPN Service].

 * *[Documentation Tunnelblick Documentation] is the best place to go if you set up your own VPN*.
  * This is the place to find both general information about Tunnelblick and specific reference material about how to set up Tunnelblick configurations.
  * This is *_not_* the place for information about *OpenVPN* or *OpenVPN configurations*, for that, see:

  * Searching the discussion group is often the fastest way to find the solution to a problem -- someone else may have already solved it!
