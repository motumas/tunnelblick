The Tunnelblick log is the record of output from OpenVPN for a connection. It includes entries from Tunnelblick giving additional information.

You can view the Tunnelblick log for a connection as follows:

 * *Tunnelblick 3.2 and up*:
   # Click on the Tunnelblick icon at the top of the screen;
   # Click "VPN Details…";
   # Select the "Configurations" pane at the top;
   # Select the configuration in the list on the left;
   # To copy the log to the Clipboard, click the "Copy Log to Clipboard" button.

 * *Earlier versions of Tunnelblick*:
  # Click on the Tunnelblick icon at the top of the screen;
  # Click "Details…";
  # Select the "Configurations" pane at the top;
  # Select the configuration in the list on the left or select the tab for the configuration;
  # To copy the log to the Clipboard, type Command-A, then Command-C.

The level of detail about OpenVPN operations in the log is controlled by OpenVPN's "verb" option.

Tunnelblick adds information to the log:
 * When started or when the log is cleared, Tunnelblick adds a line listing the versions of OS X, Tunnelblick, and OpenVPN.

 * When a connection attempt is made, Tunnelblick adds details to the log about what Tunnelblick does (as opposed to what OpenVPN does).

Sometimes entries in the log (which are prefixed by the date and time) appear out of sequence. This is because the different programs writing to the log (Tunnelblick, OpenVPN, and scripts) buffer their output. In general, though, the dates and times listed are correct.

You may use the standard keyboard shortcuts: 
||Command-C||Copy||
||Command-X||Cut||
||Command-V||Paste||
||Command-A||Select all the text in the log||
||Command-M||Minimize the window to the dock||
||Command-W||Close the window||
||Command-Q||Quit Tunnelblick||
