* Translating .rtf Files*

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

<hr>

This document describes how to translate one of the the two types of files that Tunnelblick uses for translation: .rtf files.
 * For instructions on editing the .strings files, see [cTranslateStrings Translating .strings Files]
 * For an overview of how to localize Tunnelblick, see [cLocalize Localizing Tunnelblick].
 * For an overview of the translation process, see [cTranslate Translating Tunnelblick].
 * For notes about specific strings that are being translated, see [cTranslationNotes Translation Notes].
 * For the current status of translations, see [cTranslationStatus Translation Status].

<hr>

Tunnelblick has two .rtf files for each language:
 * A "Description.rtf" file, which contains a description of the license under which Tunnelblick may be distributed.
 * A "Credits.rtf" file, which lists people who have contributed code or translations to Tunnelblick.
These files should be translated using !TextEdit or another editor (such as Windows Word or !WordPad) that can edit RTF files. They may be opened in !TextEdit by double-clicking them -- the special procedure  used to open .strings files is *not* needed for .rft files.

*Editing Credits.rtf is difficult* because the names are in a table and the formatting of the table is messed up in most of the languages. So it is a good idea to select all the names in a particular section and then click "Format", then "Tableâ€¦". In the new window that appears, change "Cell Border" to 1 px and you'll be able to see the way the table is set up. If you want to make it a less messy table, that's great, but what counts is how it looks when "Cell Border" is set to 0

_Note: The primary translator(s) of the language being translated should be listed at the end of the first section of the "Credits.rtf" file._
